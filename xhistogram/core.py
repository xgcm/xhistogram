    Parameters
    ----------
    args : array_like
        Input data. The number of input arguments determines the dimensionality
        of the histogram. For example, two arguments produce a 2D histogram.
        All args must have the same size.
    bins :  int, str or numpy array or a list of ints, strs and/or arrays, optional
        If a list, there should be one entry for each item in ``args``.
        The bin specifications are as follows:

          * If int; the number of bins for all arguments in ``args``.
          * If str; the method used to automatically calculate the optimal bin width
            for all arguments in ``args``, as defined by numpy `histogram_bin_edges`.
          * If numpy array; the bin edges for all arguments in ``args``.
          * If a list of ints, strs and/or arrays; the bin specification as
            above for every argument in ``args``.

        When bin edges are specified, all but the last (righthand-most) bin include
        the left edge and exclude the right edge. The last bin includes both edges.

        A TypeError will be raised if args or weights contains dask arrays and bins
        are not specified explicitly as an array or list of arrays. This is because
        other bin specifications trigger computation.
    range : (float, float) or a list of (float, float), optional
        If a list, there should be one entry for each item in ``args``.
        The range specifications are as follows:

          * If (float, float); the lower and upper range(s) of the bins for all
            arguments in ``args``. Values outside the range are ignored. The first
            element of the range must be less than or equal to the second. `range`
            affects the automatic bin computation as well. In this case, while bin
            width is computed to be optimal based on the actual data within `range`,
            the bin count will fill the entire range including portions containing
            no data.
          * If a list of (float, float); the ranges as above for every argument in
            ``args``.
          * If not provided, range is simply ``(arg.min(), arg.max())`` for each
            arg.
    axis : None or int or tuple of ints, optional
        Axis or axes along which the histogram is computed. The default is to
        compute the histogram of the flattened array
    weights : array_like, optional
        An array of weights, of the same shape as `a`.  Each value in
        `a` only contributes its associated weight towards the bin count
        (instead of 1). If `density` is True, the weights are
        normalized, so that the integral of the density over the range
        remains 1.
    density : bool, optional
        If ``False``, the result will contain the number of samples in
        each bin. If ``True``, the result is the value of the
        probability *density* function at the bin, normalized such that
        the *integral* over the range is 1. Note that the sum of the
        histogram values will not be equal to 1 unless bins of unity
        width are chosen; it is not a probability *mass* function.
    block_size : int or 'auto', optional
        A parameter which governs the algorithm used to compute the histogram.
        Using a nonzero value splits the histogram calculation over the
        non-histogram axes into blocks of size ``block_size``, iterating over
        them with a loop (numpy inputs) or in parallel (dask inputs). If
        ``'auto'``, blocks will be determined either by the underlying dask
        chunks (dask inputs) or an experimental built-in heuristic (numpy inputs).

    Returns
    -------
    hist : array
        The values of the histogram.
    bin_edges : list of arrays
        Return the bin edges for each input array.
